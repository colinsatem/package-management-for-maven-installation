Install Docker on Red Hat Enterprise Linux AWS EC2
#Step 1 – Check Linux version
#There is a minimum kernel requirement for Docker. It must be at least version 3.10. To find out the kernel version, please use:

uname -a
or
uname -r
#Step 2 – Update yum
#We should always update the operating system in an EC2 instance. To update the Red Hat Enterprise Linux, please use the following command.

sudo yum update
#Step 3 – Add Docker Repository
#We need to point a Docker repository for our operating system. Please run the following command.

sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo <<-'EOF'
[dockerrepo]
name=Docker Repository
baseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/7/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg
EOF
#Notice the baseurl points to https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/7/

#If we access the https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/, we get this page. Depending on our requirement, we may need to choose Docker binaries for either version of CentOS. For our case, we use version 7.
#Step 4 – Install Docker Engine
#Then, we install docker-engine. Please run the following command.

sudo yum install docker-engine
Step 5 – Enable Docker Service
#Then, we need to enable to Docker service. At this point, Docker is installed but disabled. Please run the following command to allow the Docker service to run.

sudo systemctl enable docker.service
#Step 6 – Start Docker
#Finally, we need to start the Docker server. Please use the following command.

sudo systemctl start docker
#Step 7- Verify Docker is Running
#Once we started the Docker server, we can check to see if it is up and running. Please use the following command.

ps -ef | grep docker

#Then, we successfully installed Docker in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux AWS EC2.
