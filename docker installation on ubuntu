Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, you will need the following:

One Ubuntu 20.04 server set up by following the Ubuntu 20.04 initial server setup guide, including a sudo non-root user and a firewall.
An account on Docker Hub if you wish to create your own images and push them to Docker Hub, as shown in Steps 7 and 8.
#First, update your existing list of packages:

sudo apt update

Next, install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS:

sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
Then add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system:

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
Add the Docker repository to APT sources:

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
This will also update our package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo.

Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo:

apt-cache policy docker-ce
Youâ€™ll see output like this, although the version number for Docker may be different:

Output of apt-cache policy docker-ce
docker-ce:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 5:19.03.9~3-0~ubuntu-focal
  Version table:
     5:19.03.9~3-0~ubuntu-focal 500
        500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal/stable amd64 Packages
Notice that docker-ce is not installed, but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository for Ubuntu 20.04 (focal).

Finally, install Docker:

sudo apt install docker-ce
sudo systemctl status docker
# command to add user to sudoersfile in linux
echo "username  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/username
#To view all available subcommands, type:
docker
#To view system-wide information about Docker, use:

docker info
To check whether you can access and download images from Docker Hub, type:

docker run hello-world
